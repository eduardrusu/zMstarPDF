Photoz/Mstellar codes
=====================
Code         To Do
----------   -----------------
BPZ          Check to see that the tabulated P(z|H_BPZ) is accessible
Eazy         --
LePhare      Look for tabulated PDFs for P(M_stellar) or P(M_stellar,z_phot)
             READ paper/manual
             Try to generate joint PDF if not accessible
	      - in this case, add a factor that takes into account the
	        correlation btwn stellar mass and z (a D_L^2 factor)
		NB: LePhare may already do this, given the asymmetric
		uncertainties.
             Does P(M_stellar) include z uncertainty already?

StellarPops  Make it work!

CFHTLens
========
Find out what value of h they used
See if we can get their LePhare config files
Star/gal separation

github
======
Set up a H0licow organization
Set up an environment repo
  python
  Data
*[]    - spec-z catalogs
    - short example photometry files, just for testing the code

Comparison to the Millennium sims
=================================
Run photo-z code(s) on mock galaxy catalogs and compare to "spec-z" values
 that are in the catalogs
Ditto for the stellar masses
Make histograms of 0435/sim_fields for (weighted) number counts and compare
 to 0435/CFHTLens_field histograms
 - try using the same number of fields in the sims as we used in the
   CFHTLens histograms.  Then, for each sim field, use the mask that
   correspondes to one of the CFHTLens fields

ABC approach
============
Look into formalizing the comparison to the Millennium into a ABC approach
 - We have a bunch of summary statistics
 - Consider calculating our ratios (i.e., zeta values from Edi's histograms)
   within apertures of different radii
